  == Development Environment ==
  * KEILMDK Version: 5.12 or above.
  * Programmer/Debugger: ST-LINK V2
  * Programming/Debugginginterface: JTAG/SWD

  == How to use ==
  1. Plug the NandFlash Board to the 8BIT FSMC port on the board.
  2. Connect the board to your PC using a serial module, through the UART1 port.
     * Baud rate: 115200
     * Data bits: 8
     * Stop bits: 1
     * Parity: None
     * Flow control: None
  3. Power up and data will be written to the NandFlash Board, then the serial port
     will print the information.

  == Attention ==
  The CLE and ALE pins on the development board are A17 and A16 but the default code
  generated by STM32CubeMX uses A16 for CLE and A17 for ALE.
  So if the source code is generated by STM32CubeMX again, you should manually edit 
  the stm32f4xx_hal_nand.h file and modify:
  
  #define CMD_AREA                   ((uint32_t)(1U<<16U))
  #define ADDR_AREA                  ((uint32_t)(1U<<17U))
  
  to:\r\n"
  
  #define CMD_AREA                   ((uint32_t)(1U<<17U))
  #define ADDR_AREA                  ((uint32_t)(1U<<16U))
